# Age Insight Application

## Overview:
The Age Insight application allows users to calculate and display the age difference between two selected dates: the birth date and the current date. The user interacts with the application through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

## Key Features:
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  The GUI provides a visually appealing and user-friendly design. Calendar widgets are used for easy date selection.

- **Real-Time Clock:**  
  The application displays the current time in real-time, updating every half second. The clock is implemented using the `pytz` library to account for time zones, with the default set to 'Asia/Kolkata'.

- **Date Processing:**  
  The application processes the selected birth and current dates to calculate the age in terms of days, months, and years.

- **Dynamic Label Updates:**  
  Labels dynamically update to show the selected birth and current dates, as well as the calculated age in days, months, and years.
