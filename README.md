This repository contains the source code for an Age Finder GUI application developed in Python using the Tkinter library for the user interface and the tkcalendar library for date picking functionality.

Overview:
    The Age Finder application allows users to calculate and display the age difference between two selected dates: the birth date and the current date. The user interacts with the application through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

Key Features:

    - User-Friendly Interface:
        The GUI provides a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
        Calendar widgets are used for easy date selection.
        
    - Real-Time Clock:
        The application displays the current time in real-time, updating every half second.
        The clock is implemented using the pytz library to account for time zones, with the default set to 'Asia/Kolkata'.
    
    - Date Processing:
        The application processes the selected birth and current dates to calculate the age in terms of days, months, and years.
    
    - Dynamic Label Updates:
        Labels dynamically update to show the selected birth and current dates, as well as the calculated age in days, months, and years.
